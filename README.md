# Intern Theory

Interships and Online Courses for College Students | Intern Theory

We began as a quartet of 20-somethings, headed with one objective, to help our fellow mates land an internship. One year since, and we are a team of 12, with an extended family of thousands of students and companies using our services.

Our fondest memory is that of the earliest calls we received from students who were ecstatic about landing an internship via our portal.
